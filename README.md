## **Overview**

**This repository contains the following artifacts developed and enhanced as part of my coursework:**

**TaskService and ContactService**

        These artifacts implement core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing tasks and contacts.
        Enhancements include the addition of new methods such as updateTaskName, updateTaskDescription, updatePhoneNumber, and setStatus. These updates improved functionality and usability while maintaining clean code and                  adherence to object oriented principles.

**Appointment Management System**

        This artifact is a scheduling system designed to manage and organize appointments efficiently.
        Enhancements focused on refining input validation, improving the user interface (via console interactions), and adding robust error handling to accommodate various edge cases.

**JUnit Tests**

        Comprehensive JUnit test cases were developed for TaskService, ContactService, and individual Task and Contact objects.
        These tests ensure the reliability of each method, validating that the code handles expected and edge case scenarios effectively.

**Features
TaskService & ContactService**

        Manage tasks and contacts with unique IDs.
        Methods for adding, deleting, updating, and retrieving data.
        Input validation to ensure data consistency and integrity.

**Appointment Management System**

        Handles appointment scheduling with functionality for adding, updating, and removing appointments.
        Focus on real world use cases, such as preventing conflicts and ensuring user friendly workflows.

**Unit Testing**

        Ensures all enhancements and new features function correctly.
        Validates updates do not introduce regressions or bugs.

**Enhancements Overview**

**The enhancements introduced across all artifacts demonstrate:**

        Improved Functionality: Additional methods and features to handle real world scenarios.
        Code Optimization: Refactored methods for clarity, performance, and maintainability.
        Testing and Validation: Added unit tests to ensure functionality and reliability.

**Usage**

        TaskService and ContactService: Ideal for learning CRUD operations and exploring modular design in Java.
        Appointment Management System: Practical example of managing scheduling tasks in a professional setting.
        Unit Tests: Templates for implementing and validating code functionality with JUnit.

**Getting Started**

        Clone the repository.
        Navigate to the appropriate artifact folder (e.g., TaskService, ContactService, or AppointmentSystem).
        Open the project in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
        Run the JUnit test classes to verify functionality or execute the main classes to explore the program's features.

These artifacts showcase my abilities in software design, implementation, and testing. Each enhancement reflects my growth as a developer and my ability to deliver reliable, user-focused software solutions.

_**The zip files provided with the word Milestone associated with it are the indications that have been provided for the progress from the beginning of the course throughout the entirety. It shows enhancements and reflections
of each milestone as I polished and redesigned the artifacts.**_
